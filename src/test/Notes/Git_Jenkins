Git fetch--> downloads the changes from the remote repository to the local repository but does not make any changes to the current working directory.
 Since the changes are not merged into the local branch, you can check the changes from the remote repository without interrupting your current work.

Git pull--> git pull retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository like git fetch, but it also automatically merges those changes into the current branch.
  In contrast to git fetch, git pull directly applies the changes from the remote repository to the local working directory.

  Git fetch-->download the changes from remote but not merge into local
  Git pull-->download the changes from remote and merge into local

Git Rebase-->Rebase is one of two Git utilities designed to integrate changes from one branch into another. Rebasing combines or moves a sequence of commits on top of a new base commit.
Git rebase is the linear process of merging.
Git rebase(simple word)-->its uses to move the changes from one branch to another branch.

Difference between Git Rebase vs Git Merge?
git merge combines changes from one branch (source branch) into another branch (target branch),
 while git rebase moves the changes from one branch to another branch
