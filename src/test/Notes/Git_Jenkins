Git fetch--> downloads the changes from the remote repository to the local repository but does not make any changes to the current working directory.
 Since the changes are not merged into the local branch, you can check the changes from the remote repository without interrupting your current work.

Git pull--> git pull retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository like git fetch, but it also automatically merges those changes into the current branch.
  In contrast to git fetch, git pull directly applies the changes from the remote repository to the local working directory.

  Git fetch-->download the changes from remote but not merge into local
  Git pull-->download the changes from remote and merge into local
