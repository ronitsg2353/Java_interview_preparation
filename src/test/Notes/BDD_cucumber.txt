 Scenario -->Scenario" is used for individual, non-parameterized test cases
 Scenario outline--> "Scenario Outline" is used for parameterized test cases where the same steps are executed with different sets of input data.

 dry run-->compile the stepDefination files and feature files.Its runs find any compilation errors.

hooks-->myhook.java file in project-->the hooks are used to control the flow of the program and optimize lines of code. A block of code tagged with hooks
in Cucumber can run before or post a scenario with the help of @Before and @After annotations.

1.what is cucumber?
-->Cucumber is a testing tool based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework. It is used to run functional tests written in plain text and develop test cases for software functionality. It plays a supporting role in automated testing.

2.aim of bdd(behavior driven Development)--> to understand the test scenarios to tech team as well as non tech team.

3.purpose of feature file?--> high level description of test scenarios.
6.Step Definition file?-->actual code of implementation
8.starting point of feature file?---> Test Runner class
9. hooks ?
-->the hooks are used to control the flow of the program and optimize lines of code. A block of code tagged with hooks in Cucumber can run before or post a scenario with the help of @Before and @After annotations.

10.option tag?-->
Options tag is a part of the Test Runner file and comes in the form of an annotation called @CucumberOptions. It contains two parameters feature and glue.

Feature parameter: The feature parameter is used to specify the path of the feature file.
Glue parameter: The glue parameter is used to specify the path of the step definition file.
