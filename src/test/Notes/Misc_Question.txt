Hello MY name is Ronit.I have 5 years of experience as Quality Assurance Engineer specialization in
both manual & automation across domain like banking and finanical services.I have expertise in designing
automation framework using tools like selenium and Rest Assured,implementing BDD with cucumber & working
with CI?CD pipeline using jenkins.MY experience includes end to end testing,API testing & regression testing
with strong focus on test efficency & defect detection.I developed resuable automation script that reduced
regrssion time by 40% and ensure more than 80% test coverage.Im passionate about delivering high quality
software,collabrating with team & continous enhancing to business goal.

                        ### explain project structure ###

 In my BDD project,I used cucumber with junit to automate testing for banking application,focus on
 authentication services.The framework was built using Java & POM structure with dedicated packages for
 feature fils,StepDefinition ,page classes and utitlies ensure scalability & maintainability.
 Gherkin is used to write feature file to make clear communicayion between technical and non techincal stakeholder
 I implemented stepDefinition in java,integrated framwork with jenkins ci/cd use cucumber plugin for generated
 report.This approach testing proccess reduced the manual efforts.

1.Difficulties in Automation testing?
1.Rapid changes in UI--> changing ui--updating locators and some methods.
2.flakiness -->
3.Maintaining test data-->

2.Difficulties in Agile?
1.changing requirement-->
2.Lack of communication between tester and dev
3.Not enough information
4.Time constraint

3.Testing in one day before Prod?
1.inform the stakeholder and scrum
2.prioritze test cases-smoke and regression
3.critical path & high priority testing
4.Exploratory testing-->identify the hidden issue through unscripted testing of high risk modues
