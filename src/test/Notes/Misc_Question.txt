                        ### Introduction ###
Hello MY name is Ronit.I have 5 years of experience as Quality Assurance Engineer specialization in
both manual & automation across domain like banking and finanical services.I have expertise in designing
automation framework using tools like selenium and Rest Assured,implementing BDD with cucumber & working
with CI?CD pipeline using jenkins.MY experience includes end to end testing,API testing & regression testing
with strong focus on test efficency & defect detection.I developed resuable automation script that reduced
regrssion time by 40% and ensure more than 80% test coverage.Im passionate about delivering high quality
software,collabrating with team & continous enhancing to business goal.

                        ### explain project structure ###

 In my BDD project,I used cucumber with junit to automate testing for banking application,focus on
 authentication services.The framework was built using Java & POM structure with dedicated packages for
 feature fils,StepDefinition ,page classes and utitlies ensure scalability & maintainability.
 Gherkin is used to write feature file to make clear communication between technical and non techincal stakeholder
 I implemented stepDefinition in java,integrated framwork with jenkins ci/cd use cucumber plugin for generated
 report.This approach testing proccess reduced the manual efforts.

1.Difficulties in Automation testing?
1.Rapid changes in UI--> changing ui--updating locators and some methods.
2.flakiness -->
3.Maintaining test data-->

2.Difficulties in Agile?
1.changing requirement-->
2.Lack of communication between tester and dev
3.Not enough information
4.Time constraint

3.Testing in one day before Prod?
1.inform the stakeholder and scrum
2.prioritze test cases-smoke and regression
3.critical path & high priority testing
4.Exploratory testing-->identify the hidden issue through unscripted testing of high risk modules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q .Describe a situation where you had to work unser pressure to meet a deadline.How did you manage
your time and task?
-->
while working as automation tester,i was assigned to develop and exceute a critical suite of automated test
cases for TIAa bank related project.the deadline was tight due to an upcoming release,there wew last minute changes
to the application that required immediate adjustment to test script.

1.prioritization-->i quickly identified high priority test cases that has the maximum impact-on app core functionality
2.Planning-->i broke the work into smaller tasks,setting clear milestones for script updates,execution and reporting
3.collaboration-->i communicated with developers to understand changes,ensuring my scripts aligned with updated functionality
4.time mangement-->i utlized a combination of focused work session and regular check in to monitor progress
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.2 hOW do you prioritize testing tasks when faced with tight deadlines?
1.Identify critical feautre-->communicate with scrum to understand which feature are most critical to business or end user
2.Assess risk-->focus on area with high risk such as new feature ,bug fixes or complex integration
3.Categories the test cases
   High priority tc--> high risk area,critical user journey
   Medium priority tc-->secondary feature and edge cases
   Low priority tc-->non critical functionalities and minor UI/ux checks

4.Automate repetitve and regression test to save time for manual exploratory testing
5.execute automated test in parallel using ci/cd pipelines to speed up results.
6.break tasks into smaller chunks and assigns to deadlines
7.collabration with develops
8.perform exploratory testing-->exploratory testing helps uncover critical issue quickly
